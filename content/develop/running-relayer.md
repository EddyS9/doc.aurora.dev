# Running Aurora RPC

Aurora Labs offers out of the box RPC to connect to Aurora network. See details on [Networks](https://doc.aurora.dev/develop/networks).

To setup your own RPC endpoint use the **[Partner RPC repository](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/partner-relayer-deploy)**. This involves running a NEAR node and an aurora indexer.
